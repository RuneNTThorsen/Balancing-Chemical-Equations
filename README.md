# Balancing-Chemical-Equations
This repository is a project where I will use linear algebra to make a C++ program to balance a given chemical equation.

To see how linear algebra can be used to balance chemical equations, please read the pdf. The tex file used for generating the .pdf is also provided, in case you would like to make any changes to the pdf.
